# BayWheels Trip Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes BayWheels trip data to gain insights into user behavior, trip patterns, and overall system performance. The dataset includes details about individual trips, user types, and station usage trends.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of structured CSV files containing:
- **Trip ID**: Unique identifier for each trip
- **Start Time & End Time**: Timestamp of trip initiation and completion
- **Start & End Station**: Locations where the trip started and ended
- **User Type**: Subscriber or customer classification
- **Bike ID**: Unique identifier for each bike

## Objectives
- Identify peak usage hours and popular stations
- Analyze trip duration distribution
- Compare subscriber vs. customer usage patterns
- Identify trends in bike demand

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis
